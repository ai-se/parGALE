## Feature Space Division
- Randomly select **n** * 25 points and construct a decision tree with **n** leaves. **n** represents the number of processor.
- For each leaf identify the range inputs within the range.
- For each processor: randomly assign input range of one leaf.
- Decisions will now be generated within only this input range.
